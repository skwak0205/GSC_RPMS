This module contains the built UWA files with AMD module concatenated 
using their dependencies order as well as CSS with resolved @import rules

It is meant to be referenced from Standalone Widget only, and is equivalent
to the build files available on http://uwa.netvibes.com/lib/c/UWA

This module will be replaced by UWA.mweb at a later point.
