	 * JSON.stringify accept a custom made replacer so that a dev can tweak and customize the stringification process as he see fit. For Studio
	 * we use that entry point in order to be able to cut cycles in the graph formed by Studio Objects and references between them. In practice
	 * if you took care to flag these references as 'weak' through the use of attribute these references will be replaced in the serialization
	 * by information that can be used by the other side to re generate those references.
	 * On top of that this replace is meant to work on objects that are deriving somehow from STU.Instance which bear a replacer method. This 
	 * replacer will ensure that the replacer method on your object will be called. So if you are serializing a family of objects that has 
	 * overridden that behavior you are free to control the serialization as you see fit (and thus to cut cycles that you want to cut). You can check
	 * STU.Behavior for an example of how this can be used.
	 *
	 * It is worth noting that JSON.stringify calls a function not a class so in fact the replacer that will be used is the function that 
	 * is returned by the getReplacer method. Some data are 'hidden' in it's closure, don't remove them they are used as yet another mechanism
	 * to cut cycles. You can view the closure as a kind of serialization context which record state information while the process is progressing.
	 * If the value of the property you are processing has already been serialized the below code will automatically deal with it as a 'weak' reference
	 * and won't attempt to serialize it again in depth. It will just place in the serialization output some useful information so one can link back
	 * objects while processing the JSON string is needed.
	 *
