  "summary": "This block helps you synchronise your control and data flow. It will activate the output control port as soon as all input control ports have been activated. For a more complexe scenario (for example executing this block multiple times), please read the detailed description below.",
  "description": "Each input control port has an internal counter which is incremented when the port has been activated and decremented when the block is exiting through the output control port <doc-ocp-name translate=no>Out</doc-ocp-name>. Every time a input control port is activated, the block is executed, and will exit through the output control port <doc-ocp-name translate=no>Out</doc-ocp-name> only if all the input control port internal counters are stricly greater than 0.",
